Summary of DataSet:-

Accident Details – Date, time, month, year, and day of the week.
Location Data – Latitude, longitude, urban/rural classification, and local district.
Accident Severity – Whether the accident was "Slight," "Serious," or "Fatal."
Road & Environmental Conditions – Road type, road surface condition, speed limit, light conditions, and weather conditions.
Junction & Traffic Control – Junction type and control method (e.g., traffic signals, give way).
Vehicles & Casualties – Number of vehicles involved, number of casualties, and vehicle types.
Police Force Data – Identifies the police force handling the accident.



What we can Analyze from this Dataset:-

1. Accident Trends Over Time
Number of accidents per month/year to identify seasonal patterns.
Accident frequency by day of the week & time of day (e.g., peak hours vs. late-night).
2. Accident Severity Analysis
Distribution of accident severity (Slight, Serious, Fatal).
Factors affecting severity: Weather, Speed Limit, Road Type, Junction Type.
3. Vehicle & Casualty Analysis
Most common vehicle types involved in accidents.
Relationship between number of vehicles and casualties per accident.
4. Road & Environmental Impact
Accidents by road type (single carriageway, dual carriageway, one-way).
Impact of weather conditions & road surface on accident rates.
Influence of light conditions (daylight vs. darkness) on accident frequency.
5. Geographic Analysis (Heatmaps & Hotspots)
Mapping accident locations using latitude & longitude.
Identifying high-risk urban vs. rural areas.
6. Traffic Control & Junction Analysis
Impact of traffic signals vs. uncontrolled junctions on accidents.
Common junction types where accidents occur the most.
7. Speed Limit Impact
Comparing accident counts under different speed limits.
Do higher speed limits lead to more severe accidents?
8. Police Force Performance
Number of accidents reported by different police forces.
Are certain districts handling more accident cases?



Here is a step-by-step summary of how you completed your dashboard project:-

Data Cleaning:

Corrected data types for consistency.
Identified and handled missing values by filling them appropriately.
Standardized similar values with different spellings.
Data Analysis:

Used Pivot Tables to summarize and analyze key insights.
Created visualizations using charts for better understanding.
Dashboard Creation:

Designed an interactive dashboard with relevant charts and tables.
Implemented slicer buttons to filter data and improve navigation.
Added a slicer button to navigate to another page for a seamless user experience.



Excel file contains multiple sheets, including:

KPI – Likely contains key performance indicators.
Monthwise Casualties – May have accident or casualty data by month.
Road Type – Possibly data on accidents based on different road types.
Vehicle – Could contain accident statistics related to vehicle types.
Dashboard – Likely the visual representation of the analysis.
Dataset – Likely the raw data used for analysis.
